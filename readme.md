I no longer do any work with Ext.net and have no interest in maintaining this source code.
With Sencha and Ext.net's current license arrangements, I'm not even sure such a library can
exist without violating both Sencha's and High Chart's licensed.



# Ext.NET Wrapper for HighCharts Sencha
Created by Peter Godwin (<pgodwin@gmail.com>)

As per the title, this is an Ext.Net control for HighCharts. It utilises the excellent HighCharts Sencha extension by Joe Kuan (<kuan.joe@gmail.com>).

This control is currently in a very early state of development and is missing substantial amounts of functionality. It is currently in more of a PoC stage.

Code Generation
---------------
The `Utils.HighChartClassGen` project contains methods used to generate .NET classes from the HighChart API documentation JSON. It's not perfect, and was hacked together one afternoon so will be full of bugs. However I believe it'll prove to be a fairly quick way of exposing the underlying Javascript API to .NET develoeprs, and keeping the .NET control in sync with HighChart.
